            As a caregiver make sure you wash your hands frequently and remind your older loved one to do the same. Using the soap properly and washing hands thoroughly is an effective way to get rid of germs. Always keep a sanitizer with you and
            make
            sure to keep one near your senior loved one. Sanitizers can make the hands dry and the elderly have fragile skin. It would be useful to keep a good hand cream or moisturizer so they can apply the cream whenever they need it.

            Avoid Contact With People Who Are Sick

          <div class="content">
            Many people end up going to work even if they are sick. It is extremely important to stay home if you are sick so you can recuperate and prevent the germs from spreading. Diseases like the Coronavirus are spread quickly and quite
            difficult
            to contain, so take the proper measures and stay away from others who are sick. As a caregiver, if you feel you are coming down with the flu, make the necessary arrangement for someone else to take care of your senior loved one till you
            recover.

          <div class="content">
            Seniors may have a lot of dietary restrictions which makes it difficult to do meal planning. And with a weaker immune system, it is even more important to give your elderly family member proper food. Protein in the form of fish, yogurt,
            fresh fruit, steamed vegetables is great for immunity, strength and overall health maintenance.

          <div class="content">
            Being proactive is the key to maintaining a senior’s health. No symptom should be overlooked and if you feel your senior is lacking strength, coming down with a cold, feeling weak or having difficulty walking, notify your doctor right
            away.
            Sometimes minor symptoms can indicate an underlying problem. Flu in seniors with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) or other respiratory problems can quickly escalate and become life-threatening. Seek immediate help from the
            doctor if any symptom appears.

            Keep The Environment Clean
          </h1>
          <div class="content">
            A clean and safe environment is not just safe for your senior but you as a caregiver as well. Since caregivers and seniors spend a lot of time together it is important to keep all belongings, pillboxes, cell phones, iPad and tables clean
            and sanitized. Dust can prove to be a very strong allergen for those with severe asthma or respiratory issues. Keeping your environment clean and dust free is beneficial for everyone.
